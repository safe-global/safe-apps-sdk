## Testing your Safe App

You can directly use [our production interface](https://app.safe.global) for testing your Safe App


## Setting up development environment

### Installing dependencies

```
npm i -g lerna
yarn global add lerna

lerna bootstrap
```

### Running commands

We will use `build` command as an example. Same applies to other commands.

For all packages:

```
lerna run build
```

For a specific package:

```
lerna run --scope @safe-global/safe-apps-sdk build --stream
```

`--stream` options enables command output. By default, lerna displays it only in case of an error.
